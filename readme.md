An app to fetch the latest code from git, and run it.

I'm building prototypes with AvaloniaUI.
Often I want someone to try it out real quick.
But not everyone knows git,
much less how to compile and run a dotnet application.
And even if they do, why should they have to bother?

This is a barely working proof of concept right now.
It probably only works on my machine.
